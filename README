Simulator Launcher

== Introduction ==

This is a Mac OS X application that will automatically launch an embedded iPhone Simulator application
using the correct SDK.

The launcher will:
- Detect all installed iPhone SDKs (such as the beta iPad SDK) using Spotlight.
- Automatically select the best available SDK for your application.
- Install and launch your application in the appropriate Simulator.

To use, place your iPhone/iPad application in:
    Launcher.app/Contents/Resources/EmbeddedApp/

You can also rename the Launcher.app, and provide a proper Icon.

== Building ==

The launcher should build and run on Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6.

Building also requires the PLBlocks 1.1-beta2 SDK to support blocks on 10.5:
